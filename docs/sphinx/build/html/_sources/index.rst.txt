Easy Manipulation Deployment
========================================================

A modular and easy to deploy ROS2 manipulation pipeline that integrates perception elements to establish an end-to-end pick and place task.

This package was tested with the `easy_perception_deployment <https://github.com/ros-industrial/easy_perception_deployment/>`_ ROS2 package, but any other perception system that provides the same ROS2 message in the right topic can work with this package as well.
